# FUTURE IMPROVEMENTS

I would have loved to have implemented some Tests. I have used Mocha and Chai (after learning about them in Codecademy Pro but am still learning TDD and BDD) but never used Jest, so learning more about TDD would have been extremely useful, but simply didn't have time in this project.
(I'm very keen to learn!!)

I should have sorted out a better way to show any errors on search keyword, such as when symbols are entered.. but again, didn't want to take the mick and turn this into a week long project!

I would implement a notifications component card, that could show errors such as no items found or items out of stock.

I could also implement an option that a user could click on an out of stock item and leave their information to be updated when it is back in stock.

Once again, I was restrained by time, I would have added a loading spinner for use whilst fetching the data, rather than just displaying 'Loading...' text,
but time was against me (to try to keep to around 6 hours (more like 9)).

I would build a landing page.

I would finish the checkout and shipping address page.

I would improve the design and UI, it is ok but needs a lot of sharpening. In terms of responsiveness it is alright for desktops, but needs work on the mobile presentation, thankfully Bootstrap took care of a lot of that!

I would probably try to better componentise the different routes on the server. I realise that it matters less on this project due to the small amount of routes, but it doesnt allow for easy debugging or expansion, so I would absolutely divide off all the different route options from the server.

There are so many improvements I could make, but giving myself a definite time restraint really helped me work as quickly as possible and stopped decisions taking too long.
