# A Coding Test for Verse One

This is a coding test for Verse One.
I was asked to build an Online Shop using whatever stack I liked.

As I have more experience in React and with Express, I thought I'd use those.

There was no database to use in this test, purely a .json file in the back end
so although it could encapsulate hours of time, it was suggested it should take around
6 hours.

To see details about the build please read the markdown files
