# RUNNING IT

I am not exactly sure what this particular section is meant to entail.

If it is how I came to run the build.. then my apologies, the MYAPPROACH document is groaning under the weight of that information!

If it is instead how to see it in action, I can deploy it to heroku or netlify.
Hopefully the UI is simple enough to need no explanation.

If it is still another option, perhaps how I would run it in production?

Firstly everything for the backend would need to be changed the API updated for whatever databse was being used. This would make the whole api more robust.

Then I would probably need to add some testing!
I am very keen to learn testing, but have not yet had much opportunity apart from a couple of uses of mocha and chai.
I imagine it would be a job in itself writing out tests for the build now it is in a larger shape.

In terms of running it in production, I would also need to do some bug fixes.
This would be a regular maintenance I'm sure.
There are a couple, but I will leave them out of this document, to see if you find them before you have read the improvements document.
