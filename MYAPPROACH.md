# My Approach

I have only worked on one React based e-commerce project before, so this was a
great challenge to try to do as efficiently and cleanly as possible.

## My objectives were:

-Implementing a RESTful API
-Creating an easily interactable Front end GUI with good UI/UX
-Work on Tests as much as I could (as I have very little experience with testing)

### I decided to build out the front end first.

I created a little javascript file with an array of product data that I could use to at least see my UI/UX in action whilst building it.

I considered writing some SCSS for the project, but as the project was not meant to take too long, I decided to use react-bootstrap instead (that way I could spend more time on the API and the testing).

I also realised that I could spend hours deliberating over so many elements of bootstrap customisation, so I decided to import a bootswatch theme (as I have for a couple of projects before) subsquently reducing my need for customisation on the UI to a much smaller amount. As well as that, a use of the CDN of fontawesomes icon library saved a lot of time I could have wasted sizing icons and making/putting in svgs.
